# Monte-Carlo
Code for weiner process and Monte Carlo simulations with Poisson jumps, csv dump, csv readfile, ARCH volatility adjustments, and plotting

To use, you will have to manually input the appropriate stock information. Make sure that you either turn off the poisson jumps or enter the appropriate values. When you input your volatility spreadsheet, try to format it the same as the one I have uploaded, or just import it yourself. 

Model should run reasonably fast, remember that a good model should have at least 500 time steps and 2000 trials. This can take a few minutes to run. Anything over 5 minutes and you may want to make sure you aren't getting stuck in a loop.
